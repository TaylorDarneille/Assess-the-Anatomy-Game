Welcome to Assess the Anatomy, a two-player trivia game that tests your human anatomy knowledge!

Once the game begins, a random number generator selects a question from my questions array. The player has the chance to answer the question and earn a point if they are correct. Then, it is the next player's turn. The first player to get 3 correct answers is the winner! You can then reset the board to play again.
