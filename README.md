## Concept
Welcome to Assess the Anatomy, a two-player trivia game that tests your human anatomy knowledge!

## Technologies Used:
*HTML
*CSS
*Javascript

Once the game begins, a random number generator selects a question from my questions array. The first player has the chance to answer the question and earn a point if they are correct by clicking on a possible answer. Then, it is the next player's turn. The first player to get 3 correct answers is the winner! You can then reset the board to play again.

Approach:
Using Object Oriented Programming, I wrote a variety of functions that enable random question display on the game board, a counter score function if the question answered is correct, a switch player function, and an end game function. These functions all work in tandem after the game is initiated by the game.start() function which is invoked after the "start game" button is pressed by the user.

Installation:
I am not sure what is meant by installation instructions. This game is hosted through a Git Hub link.

Challenges:
Although there are no longer bugs in my project, a major challenge I had to overcome was learning how to use the "game object" and refer to functions within my game object using the "this" method. Using this syntax incorrectly at the start of creating my project resulted in some later issues that had to be solved. I have also learned that styling is not my favorite aspect of coding.
